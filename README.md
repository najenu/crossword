# crossword
website providing a user interface for solving crossword puzzles

the main goal of this project is to get some practice messing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have fun building something that's fun to use

Current functionality:
- Entering characters into the cells
- Highlighting the user's selection when they click on a cell or clue, or navigate to a cell
- Moving selected cell with arrow keys
- Automatically moving selected cell forward on letter entry and backward on backspace

Possible future items:
- Check correctness (letter, clue, or whole puzzle level) - show win screen when whole puzzle is correct
- Read puzzles in from e.g. json files
- Find more user-friendly ways to create puzzles or import them from existing sources
- Navigate between multiple puzzles
- Progress bar
- Timer
- Support puzzles where all cells are empty and clues can be separated by bars
- Support puzzles where a cell can take multiple letters
